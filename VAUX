# SCHWA is a character needed for Azerbaijani (together with ISO
# 8859-9), spoken by 7 million people in Azerbaijan, which is likely
# to become a major trading partner of many European countries and
# companies, given its existing role as an oil supplier and its likely
# future role as one of the largest and nearest oil suppliers to the
# rest of Europe. There are attempts to get SCHWA into ISO 8859 as
# well. Information by John Clews <European@sesame.demon.co.uk>
