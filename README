These scripts (and the associated data) are used for periodic updates to
xterm's wcwidth.c file.  A comment in the file refers to these scripts:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Originally added to xterm in 2000 (patch #141), there were a couple of
 * updates from Kuhn until 2005 (patch #202), renaming entrypoints and applying
 * data from Unicode.org (e.g., 3.2, 4.0, 4.1.0).  The Unicode data is
 * transformed into tables in this file by a script "uniset" written by Kuhn.
 *
 * While Kuhn implemented the original CJK variant, it was unused by xterm
 * until Jungshik Shin used it in 2002 to implement the -cjk_width command-line
 * option.
 *
 * Kuhn added a check for the vertical forms block (double-width) in 2007;
 * other updates were derived from the Unicode.org data (release 5.0).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See 00README for Kuhn's original description of the scripts.

The uniset scripts transform the Unicode data into a table of ranges for the
character-values, which (with a few special cases) gives xterm a portable
method for obtaining character widths.  At runtime, xterm can be told to use
these tables in preference to (possibly old) system tables of character
widths.

When a new release of the Unicode data is available, I get a copy of it.
For instance, the last 2019 release was 12.1.0, here:

	ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/12.1.0/ucd/UCD.zip

Unzipping that into "this" directory, and running

	make clean
	make

gives these chunks which can be used to replace corresponding text in
xterm's wcwidth.c file:

uniset.out:
  static const struct interval combining[] = {

uniset_cjk.out:
  static const struct interval ambiguous[] = {

uniset_dbl.out:
  static const struct interval doublewidth[] = {

uniset_unk.out:
  static const struct interval unknowns[] = {

NOTE: there are other data files in this directory which are of historical
interest, and are retained here because they are less accessible than before.
